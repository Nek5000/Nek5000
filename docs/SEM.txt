@brief Routines for spectral methods

@details In this section we describe the basic building blocs of
SEM staritng from the base functions related routiens stored in
@ref speclib.f. These functions genereate set of collocation/quadrature
points and quadrature weights for Legendre polynimials.

Place for more information + rest of the functions 

In general one could add here not only functions from @ref speclib.f, 
but as well e.g. gradinet calculations @ref local_grad2, @ref local_grad3 from
@ref navier5.f, interpolation routiens and many more.

More information can be found in: @cite Abramowitz1974 @cite Canuto1988 @cite Szegoe1939

@mainpage Nek5000 CFD solver

@section intro Introduction
This is an doxygen documentation of the CFD solver [Nek5000] (https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/). 
Its main goal is to provide deeper insight inot the code structure and the computational 
method itself, so we focuse here on the code under @a ./core and @a ./3rd_party directories.
Describing the code we do not follow exacly distribution of routines between different files 
focusing rather on their functionality and grouping them in so called modules(using Doxygen 
nomenclature). An example is @ref opdssum located in @ref navier1.f, but is part of communication
module. This should help the user not only in understanding the general code workflow, but 
at the same time help in finding proper tools for the operation thay want to perform. 

This documentation is build using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). However, to 
minimise number of changes to the code itself most of the information is located in txt files under
@a ./docs directory. Files in this directory represent different modules and provide more extensive 
description of the numerical method. In the code only short description of the routine is left including
module designator and arguments description.

This documentation will be available online as part of [KTH framework] 
(https://adampep.github.io/KTH_Framework/index.html) documentation through GitHub Pages (gh-pages bfranch). 
It can be generated locally by executing at the top level of the local copy of Nek5000 repository:
@verbatim
mkdir html
doxygen ./docs/Doxyfile
rm doxygen.warning
@endverbatim
It requires doxygen 1.8.11 or newer and the dot tool from [Graphviz] (http://www.graphviz.org/). 
All files required by doxygen are located under ./docs/. It includes configuration file (Doxyfile), bibliography
(doxy.bib) and web pages contents (mainpage.dox)

@section structure Repository structure 
Here one can describe shortly repository structure, but this would be possibly repeating other documentation
files, so left under discussion.

@page runtime_parameters_page Runtime parameters.
Other information e.g. runtime parameters can be added as well, but we should avoid repetition.

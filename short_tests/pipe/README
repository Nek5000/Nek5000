This directory contains two pipe cases, where the geometry 
is altered by "subroutine usrdat2" in the .usr file.

stenosis
helix

The geometry for "stenosis" was generated by running n2to3, 
which extrudes a 2D mesh into a 3D one.  Once n2to3 is compiled,
one can create this geometry by:

n2to3 < n2to3.in

Then run genmap on the result.  The file n2to3.in can be
modified to suit.
